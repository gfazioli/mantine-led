import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-fed" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-fed/styles.css';
```

You can import styles within a layer `@layer mantine-fed` by importing `@gfazioli/mantine-fed/styles.layer.css` file.

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-fed/styles.layer.css';
```

## Usage

<Demo data={demos.configurator} />

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> The `Led` component must have exactly **two** children. The first child is the front face, and the second child is the back face.

## Controlled

You may control the state of the card by setting the `fedped` prop to `true` or `false`.
This is useful when you want to control the state of the card from the parent component.

<Demo data={demos.controlled} />
